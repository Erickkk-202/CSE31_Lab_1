1. How can you open a terminal from your Linux computer?
 On my computer you can open a linux terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T

a. Can you open more than 1 terminal at the same time?
On visual studo I am able to open multiple terminals by clicking on the button "new terminal". you can also do it by presing Ctrl + Alt + T three times

b. Why do you think you want to open more than 1 terminal at the same time?
The reason why you open multiple terminals at once is to run different codes at once.

command)?
The way to check the contents inside the current drectory is by typing lower case l and lower case s in the terminal.
